Privacy is not a feature. It's a fundamental right.

## The Mission

We're building production-ready privacy technologies for the decentralized web. Zero-knowledge proofs, encryption, secure computation — all the cryptographic primitives you need to build truly private applications.

Our tools let developers create applications where users maintain complete control — proving facts without revealing data, transacting with selective disclosure, communicating with end-to-end encryption.

## Two Packages, One Vision

We're currently developing two complementary privacy solutions:

###  zkthings 

  Available now 

- **proof-membership-evm** - Merkle tree membership proofs for EVM chains
- **range-proof-evm** - Prove values in ranges without revealing amounts
- **e2e-encryption-secp256k1** - End-to-end encryption for Ethereum wallets
- **e2e-encryption-ed25519** - Private messaging for Solana/StarkNet
- **More libraries coming soon**



[**Start Building with zkthings →**](zkthings/intro)

###  zkSDKjs 
Unified interface for private transactions across all blockchains. Built entirely by AI agents.
- **One API for All Chains** - Same code for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana transactions
- **AI-Built from Scratch** - Autonomous agents develop the entire SDK end-to-end
- **Universal Privacy** - Every chain's privacy protocol through one interface

Coming Q4 2025. Built by AI, for developers.

## Why Privacy Matters

Privacy enables innovation. When users trust that their data is protected, they engage more freely. When developers have robust privacy tools, they can build applications that were previously impossible.

We're making privacy practical, scalable, and accessible to every developer.

## Start Here

```bash
# Install zkthings libraries
npm install @zkthings/proof-membership-evm
npm install @zkthings/range-proof-evm
npm install @zkthings/e2e-encryption-secp256k1
```
