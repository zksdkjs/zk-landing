# Coming Q4 2025

The first public release of `@zksdkjs/core` on npm ships once the Phaseâ€¯1 roadmap in `privacy-agent/plans/zkSDK-development-plan.md` is green:

- âœ… FHEVM provider prototype complete and exercised by the fhEVM specialist recipe.
- ðŸš§ Railgun provider feature-complete with documented setup (`automation/scripts/launch-strategic-system.sh` keeps this at the top of the queue).
- ðŸ§ª Aztec provider wired to Noir contracts with PXE integration smoke-tested.

After those boxes are checked, the team will run the Release & Operations agent to prepare packaging, docs, and enterprise onboarding. Expect the first versioned packages and public docs refresh in Q4â€¯2025, with Privacy Cash and Bitcoin privacy workstreams following immediately after launch.
