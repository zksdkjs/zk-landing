# AI Agents Building zkSDK

zkSDK is built entirely by autonomous AI agents using **Block's Goose framework** with **Qwen3-Coder-Plus** (32B) for code generation and **Claude Opus/Sonnet** for strategic planning. The complete development pipeline runs 24/7 in the public `zksdkjs/privacy-agent` repository.

## 🤖 Why Goose + Qwen?

### Goose Framework
- **Local-first execution** - Full repository access, no cloud dependencies
- **Recipe-based workflows** - Encode Fortune 500 management patterns
- **Persistent memory** - Agents never restart from scratch
- **Multi-model routing** - Best model for each task

### Model Selection
- **Qwen3-Coder-Plus (32B)** via OpenRouter
  - Primary coding model
  - High throughput, excellent TypeScript/Rust
  - Used for: Developer, Tester, Example Writer

- **Claude Opus/Sonnet** via Anthropic
  - Strategic planning and research
  - Used for: Product Manager, Strategy Chief, Researcher

## 🔄 Automation Pipeline

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Stage 1: Strategy (morning)
./automation/scripts/daily-run-strategy.sh
# Runs: PM Research → Product Manager
# Output: strategy-hand-off.md

# Stage 2: Development (afternoon)
./automation/scripts/daily-run-dev.sh
# Runs: Developer Agent
# Output: dev-hand-off.md

# Stage 3: QA & Docs (evening)
./automation/scripts/daily-run-post-dev.sh
# Runs: Test Writer → Example Writer → Doc Site Writer → Daily Report
# Output: docs-hand-off.md, insights/daily/

# Or run Stage 2+3 together
./automation/scripts/daily-run-dev.sh --with-post-dev
```

### Context Preparation

Before each agent runs, `prepare-context.sh` aggregates workspace state:

```bash
# Combines:
- workspace/current/*.md       # Active sprint goals
- workspace/hubs/*.md           # Latest hand-offs
- workspace/sessions/latest     # Previous session notes
- strategy/active/current.md    # Active strategy

# Outputs:
.goose/data/context/current-session.md
```

### Hand-off System

Agents communicate via hand-off files in `workspace/hubs/`:

| File | Written By | Read By | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|---------|
| `research-latest.md` | Researcher | Product Manager | Market insights |
| `strategy-hand-off.md` | Product Manager | Developer | Requirements |
| `dev-hand-off.md` | Developer | Test Writer | What was built |
| `docs-hand-off.md` | Test/Example/Doc Writers | External | Documentation status |
| `pipeline-log.md` | All | All | Audit trail |

### Memory System

Each agent maintains persistent state in `workspace/memory/`:

```
workspace/memory/
├── developer/          # Dev agent state
│   └── CURRENT_WORK.md
├── tester/             # Test agent state
│   └── current_task.md
└── ...                 # Other agent states
```

## 🛠️ Running Agents Locally

# Install Goose
curl -fsSL https://goose.build/install.sh | sh

# Configure API keys
goose configure
# Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Claude
# Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY for Qwen
```

### Run Individual Agents

## 📊 Agent Performance

### October 2025 Stats

| Agent | Sessions | Lines Written | Tests Added | Coverage Δ |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Developer | 12 | ~2,000 | - | - |
| Test Writer | 8 | ~1,500 | 34 | +2.5% |
| Example Writer | 5 | ~800 | - | - |
| Doc Writer | 10 | ~3,000 | - | - |
| PM/Research | 6 | ~5,000 | - | - |

### Success Metrics

- **Uptime:** 24/7 (agents resume automatically)
- **Code Quality:** All PRs pass CI before merge
- **Test Coverage:** Trending toward 90% target
- **Documentation:** Updated within 24 hours of code changes
- **Velocity:** ~500 lines of production code/day

## 🎯 Agent Coordination Rules

### Priority System

1. **Blockers** - Fix broken builds immediately
2. **Critical Features** - Wallet-connect, core providers
3. **Test Coverage** - Hit 90% across all packages
4. **Documentation** - Keep docs in sync with code
5. **Nice-to-Have** - Optimizations, refactors

### Conflict Resolution

- **Code Conflicts:** Developer agent wins, Test Writer adjusts
- **Strategy Conflicts:** Product Manager makes final call
- **Documentation Conflicts:** Doc Site Writer aligns with code reality

### Hand-off Protocol

1. Agent completes work
2. Updates hand-off file with summary
3. Logs to `pipeline-log.md`
4. Next agent reads hand-off before starting
5. Context refreshed via `prepare-context.sh`

## 🔍 Monitoring & Observability

### Session Logs

Every agent session is logged:
```
~/.local/share/goose/sessions/
├── developer_20251025_163406.jsonl
├── tester_20251025_165348.jsonl
└── ...
```

### Daily Reports

Comprehensive summaries generated daily:
```
insights/daily/2025/10-October/25/
└── daily-summary.md
```

### Pipeline Audit Trail

All agent activity logged:
```
workspace/hubs/pipeline-log.md
```
