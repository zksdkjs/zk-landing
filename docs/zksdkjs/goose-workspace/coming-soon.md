# Coming Q4 2025

The first public release of `@zksdkjs/core` on npm ships once the Phase 1 roadmap in `privacy-agent/plans/zkSDK-development-plan.md` is green:

- ✅ FHEVM provider prototype complete and exercised by the fhEVM specialist recipe.
- 🚧 Railgun provider feature-complete with documented setup (`automation/scripts/launch-strategic-system.sh` keeps this at the top of the queue).
- 🧪 Aztec provider wired to Noir contracts with PXE integration smoke-tested.

After those boxes are checked, the team will run the Release & Operations agent to prepare packaging, docs, and enterprise onboarding. Expect the first versioned packages and public docs refresh in Q4 2025, with Privacy Cash and Bitcoin privacy workstreams following immediately after launch.
