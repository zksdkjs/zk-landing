# zkSDK Overview

zkSDK is the universal privacy SDK that the `zksdkjs/agent` Goose workspace is building in public. The goal is simple: expose one TypeScript-first interface that can talk to Railgun, Aztec, Zama's fhEVM, Bitcoin privacy tooling, and every future privacy stack without forcing developers to rewrite their code for each chain.

## Where the Real Work Happens

- `github.com/zksdkjs/agent/privacy-agent/sdk` is the canonical SDK source. It is a pnpm-style workspace with `@zksdkjs/core`, provider packages, recipes, examples, and scripts.
- `automation/recipes/*.yaml` defines each Goose agent. For example, `recipe-developer.yaml` continuously ships Railgun features, while `recipe-zama-fhe-specialist.yaml` deepens the fhEVM integration.
- `automation/scripts/launch-strategic-system.sh` orchestrates the full seven-agent stack. It builds memory snapshots, rotates between providers, and calls `goose run` with the correct recipe per task.
- `memory/build_progress.json` and the generated logs under `logs/` keep authoritative progress state that downstream agents (docs, marketing, QA) read.

If you want to understand the live system, clone the agent repo and inspect those directories first.

## Current Capabilities

| Module | Package | Status | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core runtime | `@zksdkjs/core` | ‚úÖ Implemented | Provides the `ZkSDK` class plus shared types like `TransferParams`, provider registration, and unified transfer orchestration. |
| Zama fhEVM provider | `@zksdkjs/provider-fhevm` | ‚úÖ Prototype shipped | End-to-end mockable encrypted transfers, balance queries, and gateway hooks for future production fhEVM networks. |
| Railgun provider | `@zksdkjs/railgun-provider` | üöß Implementation in progress | Engine bootstrapping, mnemonic-based wallet creation, and proof scaffolding are in place. Needs production RPC layouts and test coverage. |
| Privacy Cash provider | `@zksdkjs/privacy-cash-provider` | üöß Implementation in progress | Integrates Solana shielded transfers with built-in compliance guardrails and rollup-friendly settlement. |
| Aztec provider | `@zksdkjs/aztec-provider` | üß™ Skeleton + tests | Account abstraction layers, PXE service stubs, and Noir contract plumbing landed. Requires execution wiring. |
| Bitcoin privacy provider | `@zksdkjs/bitcoin-provider` | üó∫Ô∏è Planned | Strategy doc covers Silent Payments and CoinJoin design; build queued behind Railgun and Aztec. |

Status data is generated by the automation scripts in the agent repository (`automation/scripts/update_build_progress`). The marketing site mirrors those signals so docs always match the code.

## Example: Using the SDK Today

```typescript
import { ZkSDK } from '@zksdkjs/core';
import { RailgunProvider } from '@zksdkjs/railgun-provider';
import { FHEVMProvider } from '@zksdkjs/provider-fhevm';

const sdk = new ZkSDK({
  providers: {
    railgun: new RailgunProvider({
      rpcEndpoints: {
        ethereum: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<key>'
      },
      engineDbPath: './railgun-db',
      walletMnemonic: process.env.RAILGUN_MNEMONIC
    })
  },
  defaultProvider: 'railgun'
});

sdk.addProvider(
  'fhevm',
  new FHEVMProvider({
    rpcUrl: 'https://fhevm.devnet.zama.ai',
    gatewayUrl: 'https://gateway.zama.ai'
  })
);

await sdk.transfer(
  {
    chain: 'ethereum',
    token: 'USDC',
    amount: '1000000', // 1 USDC in base units
    to: '0xRecipient',
    privacy: 'shielded'
  },
  'railgun'
);

await sdk.transfer(
  {
    chain: 'ethereum',
    token: 'USDC',
    amount: '500000',
    to: '0xConfidential',
    privacy: 'anonymous'
  },
  'fhevm'
);
```

`ZkSDK` simply asks for a map of providers. You can bootstrap with whichever package is available (Railgun in this example) and add new integrations later with `sdk.addProvider()` as the Goose agents publish them. Each provider wraps its own dependencies and configuration, so importing both in the same file does not mix their state‚Äî`railgun` and `fhevm` are distinct entries in the provider registry.

Today the fhEVM provider returns mock encryption artifacts so the TypeScript surface can stabilize while Zama finishes their public network rollout. Railgun calls target the official `@railgun-community/engine` and are ready for full wiring once RPC credentials are supplied.

## Operating the Goose System

1. Install Goose (`curl -sSL https://block.github.io/goose/install.sh | bash`) and configure OpenRouter or Anthropic keys (`goose configure`).
2. From `privacy-agent/`, run `./automation/scripts/launch-strategic-system.sh`. The script rotates the Developer, Strategy, QA, Social, Marketing, and Specialist agents until you stop it.
3. For targeted work, dispatch a single recipe:  
   - Developer sprint: `goose run --recipe automation/recipes/recipe-developer.yaml --max-turns 30`  
   - fhEVM deep dive: `goose run --recipe automation/recipes/recipe-zama-fhe-specialist.yaml --max-turns 20`  
   - Social content: `goose run --recipe automation/recipes/recipe-social.yaml --max-turns 12`
4. Inspect fresh output in `outputs/social/`, `logs/`, and `~/.local/share/goose/sessions/` before drafting docs or roadmap updates.

Every doc on this site is derived from those artifacts; if you regenerate the agent outputs, re-run the relevant recipes before editing copy.

## Next Milestones

The live `plans/zkSDK-development-plan.md` document governs delivery. Key checkpoints:

- Finish the Railgun provider (proof submission, gas estimation, integration tests) and document operational setup.
- Wire the Aztec PXE client to Noir contracts, then land end-to-end sandbox tests.
- Promote the fhEVM provider from mock mode once Zama's gateway stabilizes.
- Start Privacy Cash and Bitcoin workstreams after Railgun/Aztec hit ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù in `memory/build_progress.json`.

Track progress in the agent repo first; only update this doc after confirming the automated status reports.

## Product Strategy Sources

The public copy mirrors the internal strategy bundle that the Senior Product Manager agent regenerates. Review these canonical files in `privacy-agent/strategy/product/` before changing roadmap claims:

- `user-personas.md` ‚Äì primary developer segments and adoption triggers.
- `market-analysis.md` ‚Äì market size, competitive landscape, and risk notes.
- `technical-architecture.md` ‚Äì unified interface layers and execution design.
- `product-requirements-v1.md` ‚Äì phased requirements from MVP through v2.0.
- `metrics-dashboard.md` ‚Äì KPI definitions and alert thresholds.
- `defi-integration-patterns.md` and `go-to-market.md` ‚Äì integration examples and launch sequencing.

Daily automation writes hand-offs into `privacy-agent/workspace/hubs/`, so sync this page after each pipeline run to keep external messaging aligned.
