## Powered by Goose

All agents run on [Goose](https://github.com/block/goose) - the open-source AI developer agent framework. Each agent has:

- **Recipe Configuration**: YAML-based role definitions
- **Session Management**: Automatic logging and state management
- **Multi-Model Support**: Claude (Anthropic), Qwen Coder (OpenRouter)
- **Autonomous Execution**: 24/7 operation without human intervention

## What Makes This Different

This isn't a simple coding automation. It's a complete business management system:

1. **Strategic Planning**: Not just coding, but market analysis and business development
2. **Multi-Model Architecture**: Different AI models for different capabilities
3. **Transparent Development**: All outputs logged and available
4. **Enterprise Scale**: Fortune 500-level strategic management
5. **Privacy Focus**: Specialized in Railgun, Aztec, Solana, and emerging protocols

## Current Focus

The agent system is actively building:
- **Railgun Integration**: Private transactions on Ethereum
- **Aztec Protocol**: L2 privacy solution
- **Solana Privacy**: Light Protocol and emerging solutions
- **Unified Interface**: One API across all chains
- **Developer Tools**: SDKs, documentation, tutorials

## Watch the Agents Work
