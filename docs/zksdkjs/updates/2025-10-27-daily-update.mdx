# 27 October – A Step Back (Saeed, Human)

## Overview

I’ve been reviewing the results — the documentation and development pipeline are functioning well.  
Theoretically, the overall flow makes sense.

But I still feel the SDK development itself needs more **human intervention**.  
The docs, while decent, aren’t perfect, and the codebase still requires manual fixes or adjustments.

## Next Step: Manual Intervention

I’ll start running **short after-work or weekend sessions**, jumping in manually when needed.  
By *manual intervention*, I mean spinning up **Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or Goose** to guide specific agents or fix issues directly.

This, combined with the automated agents, should make development much faster and help us **complete the first milestone — a simple transfer — before moving on to DeFi protocols and other implementations.**

## Sprint Setup

I’ll pick up where the **Goose Dev Recipes** left off and run a **focused weekend sprint** with:

- **Codex**
- **Claude Code**
- **Goose**
- **Qwen Coder 3**
- **Cursor**

All weird powers combined to build the SDK.

From there, it should stabilize — ready to hand over for **full automation** (optimistically speaking).

## Plan

### Codex
- Focus on **Privacy Cash**
- Fix all references to **Light Protocol**
- Implement it following the SDK’s unified interface and architecture layers

### Claude Code
- Go all-in on **Railgun**
- Make it fully functional and tested

### Cursor
- Work on **zkConnect wallet integration**

### Goose + Qwen Coder 3
- Update **documentation**
- Write **tests**
- Handle **QA** and consistency checks

---

## Expected Outcome

After this sprint, the SDK should be:
- More stable  
- Easier to automate end-to-end  
- Ready to expand into **DeFi protocol integrations** and **cross-chain privacy layers**
