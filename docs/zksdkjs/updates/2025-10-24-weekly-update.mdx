## Executive Summary

- Senior Product Manager run delivered the full strategy suite under `strategy/product/` (personas, market analysis, technical architecture, unified interfaces, requirements, metrics).
- Documentation and marketing flows now reference those artifacts directly; engineering hand-offs are aligned to the new unified interface specification.
- Developer automation is queued to implement the LangChain-of-privacy abstractions once the daily dev pipeline is triggered.

## Product Progress

- Finalized the **unified interface specification** that standardizes provider registration, routing, and proof orchestration (`strategy/product/unified-interface-spec.md`).
- Documented the end-to-end **technical architecture** including proof system adapters, account-model abstractions, and execution pipelines (`strategy/product/technical-architecture.md`).
- Prioritized **MVP → v1.0 → v2.0 requirements** with concrete checklists for every stage (`strategy/product/product-requirements-v1.md`).
- Captured **DeFi integration patterns** for shielded swaps, private lending, and cross-protocol liquidity (`strategy/product/defi-integration-patterns.md`).
- Outlined a phased **go-to-market plan** targeting DeFi builders, wallet teams, and institutional adopters (`strategy/product/go-to-market.md`).

## Research Highlights

- Market sizing places privacy protocols at roughly **$500 M TVL** versus a **$50 B** broader DeFi base (`strategy/product/market-analysis.md`).
- Personas emphasize three priority segments: protocol engineers, wallet/front-end developers, and institutional partners (`strategy/product/user-personas.md`).
- The **metrics dashboard** sets adoption targets (10k GitHub stars, 100k npm downloads, integration time under one hour) and monitoring thresholds (`strategy/product/metrics-dashboard.md`).

## Upcoming Work

- Run `./automation/scripts/daily-run-dev.sh` to let the developer agent translate the new specs into code and populate `workspace/hubs/dev-hand-off.md`.
- Update `strategy/active/current.md` and `workspace/current/decisions.md` after reviewing the incoming hand-offs so tomorrow’s automation inherits the latest view.
- Resume `pm_research_20251025_152244` or rerun `automation/scripts/run-pm-research.sh` to capture the missing research report in `insights/research/`.
- Mirror any additional documentation changes from `privacy-agent/docs/` (e.g., `AGENT-PIPELINE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`) into the site.

## Call to Action

1. **Developers** – launch the daily dev pipeline, review the diffs against the new architecture, and confirm the hand-off.
2. **Docs & Marketing** – continue syncing relevant strategy sections into the public site and prepare follow-up content.
3. **Leadership** – validate the promoted decisions so the orchestration scripts start tomorrow with an up-to-date roadmap
