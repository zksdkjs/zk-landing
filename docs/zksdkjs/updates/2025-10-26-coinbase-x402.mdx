## Executive Summary

The zkSDK team has completed comprehensive research on **Coinbase's x402 payment protocol** to evaluate its potential as a payment layer for privacy-preserving applications. This research lays the groundwork for a future integration that will enable seamless micropayments for privacy services.

**Status**: âœ… Research Complete | ðŸ“… Implementation Planned Q1 2026

## What is x402?

[x402](https://github.com/coinbase/x402) is an open, internet-native micropayments protocol developed by Coinbase that enables one-line integrations for accepting digital payments. Key features include:

- **Sub-cent precision**: Payments as low as $0.001
- **Zero fees**: No platform fees for resource servers
- **Fast settlement**: 2-second blockchain confirmations
- **Multi-chain support**: EVM chains (Ethereum, Base, Polygon) and Solana
- **HTTP native**: Built on the standard HTTP 402 Payment Required status code

```typescript
// Example: One line to protect your API with payments
app.use(paymentMiddleware('0xYourAddress', { '/api/*': '$0.001' }));
```

## Why x402 Matters for zkSDK

The integration of x402 with zkSDK would bring compelling value:

### For Privacy Service Developers
- **Monetize privacy features** without complex payment infrastructure
- **Standardized payment patterns** that work across all zkSDK providers
- **Cross-chain compatibility** matching zkSDK's multi-chain vision

### For AI Agents
- **Autonomous resource payment** capabilities for privacy services
- **Programmable spending controls** and budget management
- **Audit trail** for compliance and expense tracking

---

## Integration Vision (Planned)

The proposed integration would follow zkSDK's modular provider pattern. Future API could look like:

```typescript
// Future zkSDK x402 integration (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
await zkSDK.pay({
  scheme: 'x402-exact',
  chain: 'base',
  token: 'USDC',
  amount: '1000', // 0.001 USDC
  resource: 'https://api.privacy-service.com/data'
});
```
