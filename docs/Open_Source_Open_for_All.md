# Open Source & Open for All

Our goal is to make ZK development accessible to every developer.

## Our Journey
- 🌱 Starting with basic operations (array membership, range proofs)
- 🌿 Growing into token transfer frameworks
- 🌲 Proof Registry implementations
- ✨ And many more privacy-preserving primitives!

## Our Vision
One SDK, multiple chains, endless possibilities. We're abstracting away the complexity of different ZK implementations to provide a seamless development experience.

## Open Source Community
This isn't just another SDK - it's a community-driven effort to make ZK technology accessible to everyone. Every contribution matters, whether it's code, ideas, or feedback.

## Join Us
Whether you want to contribute to existing packages or bring your own ideas, we'd love to have you on board! Together, we're building the future of privacy-preserving applications.
